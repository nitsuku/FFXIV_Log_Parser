1) Add logic to compare log lines to identify phase transitions
  a. Would need to snip the time at that point and use that in calculations, store it and use that for later phase calculations to accurately get later phases.
  b. Later phase issues is what hold this back right now, need to think about how to write it without it making the code base worse.
2) Extend support for the fights that I have done.
3) Put in some updater functionality? 
  a. Not sure how to go about doing this, new to me
4)  Break up logic to get a cleaner code base
5)  Fix issues with requirements.txt installation. Able to install on my env from that but others have had issues.
  a. Package together as an exe? Unsure if python allows this functionality.
